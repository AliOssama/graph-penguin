  <h1> BookWorm Penguin data </h1>
  <p> In this graph, I collected the data from the first penguin in the dataset and I calculated the average for all different assignments
  (i.e homework,quizes, tests, and final.) To be able to put all of them in one histogram, I scaled all the averages into percentages
  instead of definite grades. </p>
